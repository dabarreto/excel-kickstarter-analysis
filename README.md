# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: Performing analysis in Excel on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

------------------------------------------

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
See Excel file Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx.

Deliverable 1 Requirements:
* A "Years" column is created based on the "Date Created Conversion" column in the Kickstarter spreadsheet (10 pt): See Tab "Kickstarter", column U "Year Created".
* A pivot table is created in a new worksheet labeled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" (5 pt): See Tab "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" .
* The pivot table filters on "Parent Category" and "Years" (10 pt).
* The columns, rows, and values in the pivot table fields are correctly populated (10 pt).
* The "Parent Category" is filtered on "theater" (5 pt).
* The row labels are changed to display the months of the year, and the campaign outcomes are sorted in descending order (5 pt).
*  A line chart is created showing the number of successful, failed, or canceled projects by month, it has a title, and it is saved as Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png (5 pt).


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
See Excel file Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx.

Deliverable 2 Requirements:
* A new sheet is created with eight columns and twelve rows, according to the instructions (3 pt).
* The COUNTIFS() function is used to populate the "Number Successful," "Number Failed," and "Number Canceled" columns, based on the project "outcome," the "goal" amount using the goal ranges in Step 3, and the Subcategory "plays" (15 pt).
* The SUM() function is used on each row to add the "Number Successful," "Number Failed," and "Number Canceled" columns to populate the "Total Projects" column (3 pt).
* The percentages of successful, failed, and canceled projects are calculated based on the data from the "Total Projects," "Number Successful," "Number Failed," and "Number Canceled" columns (3 pt).
* A line chart is created and saved as Outcomes_vs_Goals.png with the goal-amount ranges on the x-axis, the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the y-axis, and an appropriate title (6 pt).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
